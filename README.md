# Madison Lin's Portfolio Website

This website will be a personal portfolio, which includes my resume, projects, and more about me!

The Theme: Koi Fish Pond
I chose this theme because I like fish! I also felt as if I could have a lot of creative freedom with it, showcasing both my artistic and coding abilities. 

Features
I want to make an interesting and dynamic website, so I will have animated moving koi fish, which the user can click on to view my resume or my projects! I also want to add ripple effects to the mouse or fingertouch, so it looks as if you are touching the water.
